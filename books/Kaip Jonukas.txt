	In a quaint Lithuanian village, there lived a mischievous boy named Jonukas, who was known for his playful antics and infectious laughter.

	One sunny afternoon, as the villagers gathered for a festive market day, Jonukas decided to entertain the crowd with a joke. He climbed onto a wooden crate, clapped his hands for attention, and then, with a cheeky grin, he let out a loud, unexpected fart. The sound echoed across the market square, sending the villagers into fits of laughter, their initial shock quickly turning into uncontrollable giggles. Even the stern village elder, who rarely smiled, couldn't help but chuckle at Jonukas’s audacious prank.
	
	From that day on, "Kaip Jonukas paperdė" (How Jonukas Farted) became a beloved tale, reminding everyone of the simple joys of life and the unexpected ways laughter can bring a community together.
