The dungeon was a skibidy maze of nonsense. Walls were whispering, “Rizz, rizz, rizz,” while torches flickered in morse code spelling “Sigma.” The ceiling dripped something green—was it slime or ligma? He didn’t dare taste it this time. A giant rat with sunglasses and a gold chain skated past, pointing at him and saying, “Yo, cuh, you lost or what?”

He tried to reply, but all that came out was, “Bofa.” The rat nodded like this made perfect sense and moonwalked away, leaving a trail of glitter and popcorn. Somewhere behind him, chains rattled to the beat of a TikTok dance. He turned around and saw his reflection in the puddle, but it wasn’t him. It was a giant lobster, doing the worm and shouting, “Skibidy!” at the top of its lungs.

The ground shifted, turning into a river of orange soda. He waded through, feeling his feet dissolve into gummy bears. A skeleton wearing a top hat flew by, waving a flag that read, “Free Ligma!” He laughed hysterically, his voice sounding like a dolphin on helium.

A pigeon flew in through a window that hadn’t been there before, perched on his shoulder, and whispered, “Cuh, you gotta find the rizz, or it’s game over.” He nodded sagely, though he had no idea what that meant. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a banana, but it turned into a frog that croaked, “Bofa deez nuts!” and leapt away.

Suddenly, a door appeared, painted in neon pink. He touched it, and it played a melody that sounded like a ringtone from 2004. Without thinking, he pushed it open and fell up—spinning into a kaleidoscope of memes and emojis. Everything blurred, pixelated, and then—

Nothing.

Just him and the infinite void, feeling like he’d been rizzed by the universe itself.
