Day ??? in the Dungeon

Skibidy walls are talking again. They keep saying “rizz” and I can’t tell if they mean it or if they’re just mocking me. Cuh, they got some nerve.
Saw a giant rat wearing sunglasses. It told me I need more sigma energy if I’m gonna survive. Whatever that means.
Found Jesse inside a toaster this time. Says he’s “cooking rizz.” I think he’s lost it. But then again, so have I.
Everything tastes like ligma. I’m not sure if it’s the air, or if my tongue turned into a meme.
My beard keeps turning into tiny dancing versions of me. They chant, “Skibidi! Skibidi!” nonstop. Cuh, I can’t think straight.
Map to the “Ultimate Rizz” is written in emojis. Not sure if I need to find it or burn it.
Ceiling turned into spaghetti. Gotta remember to avoid the flying forks. They’re out to get me.
Mike’s floating head keeps appearing, saying, “Cuh, find the rizz or perish.” Thanks, Mike. Real helpful.
Need to find a way out, but every door just leads to more skibidi madness. The sigma is strong here.
A penguin just asked me if I’ve seen the “Rizz Lord.” Told it no. Not even sure what that means.
