	BY CHAT GPT

--ACT I, SCENE I

CRANTIUS COLTO: Ah, NIKI, my most delightful maid. How I enjoy your company.

NIKI: You are too kind, my lord. I only wish to serve and please.

CRANTIUS COLTO: Indeed, you do, with every graceful movement. Now, I believe I am in need of some attention. The hearth is cold, and I could use some warmth.

NIKI: I shall tend to the fire at once, my lord.

CRANTIUS COLTO: No, no. It is not that fire which I speak of, NIKI.

NIKI: Oh! I see, my lord. Then, what would you have me do?

CRANTIUS COLTO: Come closer, and I shall show you.

NIKI: As you wish, my lord.

--ACT II, SCENE II

NIKI: My lord, I have polished all the silver, swept the floors, and prepared your evening meal.

CRANTIUS COLTO: You have outdone yourself once again, NIKI. Truly, your hands are blessed with the talents of a master.

NIKI: Thank you, my lord. I strive to be worthy of your praise.

CRANTIUS COLTO: Worthy, indeed. You are more than worthy, my dear. In fact, there is one more task I wish for you to complete.

NIKI: Anything, my lord. Please, tell me what you desire.

CRANTIUS COLTO: I desire… you, NIKI.

NIKI: My lord! I am but a humble maid.

CRANTIUS COLTO: Humble, perhaps, but no less desirable. Come, let us abandon pretense.

NIKI: As you command, my lord.

--ACT III, SCENE III

CRANTIUS COLTO: NIKI, your presence brings such joy to these halls. Your beauty rivals that of the stars themselves.

NIKI: My lord, you honor me greatly with your words.

CRANTIUS COLTO: Words are but a trifle compared to what I feel when I look upon you. Tell me, NIKI, have you ever been in love?

NIKI: Love, my lord? I cannot say I have experienced such a thing.

CRANTIUS COLTO: Then let me show you what it means to be truly cherished.

NIKI: I am yours, my lord, in all ways.

CRANTIUS COLTO: Good, NIKI. Very good.

--ACT IV, SCENE III

LIFTS-HER-TAIL: My lord, I have brought your favorite wine.

CRANTIUS COLTO: Very good, NIKI. Leave it on the table for me, would you?

NIKI: Oh, but my lord, the wine will get warm in this weather. Should I not serve it to you immediately?

CRANTIUS COLTO: Of course, how thoughtful of you. Come closer, my dear.

NIKI: Yes, my lord.

CRANTIUS COLTO: My, my, NIKI, your scales are glistening. Have you been polishing them again?

NIKI: Oh, my lord, you flatter me. It’s just a bit of water and sunlight.

CRANTIUS COLTO: I must say, NIKI, I’ve never seen a maid quite like you. Your... dedication to service is unmatched.

NIKI: Thank you, my lord. I aim to please.

CRANTIUS COLTO: And please you do. Now, about that wine...

NIKI: Right away, my lord.

CRANTIUS COLTO: Mmm... yes, that will do nicely.
